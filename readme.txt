About this Dataset

I just performed an analysis and visualizations on the covid-19

Context

The 2019-nCoV is a contagious coronavirus that hailed from Wuhan, China. This new strain of virus has striked fear in many countries as cities are quarantined and hospitals are overcrowded. This dataset will help us understand how 2019-nCoV is spread aroud the world.

Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for open-sourcing their dataset. Their dataset is transformed into a format that is easier to handle.

Inspiration

I believe that epidemic data should be openly available and easily accessible for health professionals and data scientists. This dataset would serve as a starting point for people to gather more data about epidemics, not just statistics, but also new stories, government responses etc.
